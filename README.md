Project Metrics:

Priority:

  Priority 1 - basic system - will be necessary for the system to function at all.  Having a user account, Storing user profile and at least some profile settings are examples of priority 1 items.  Items specifically required by the professor are also priority 1.

  Priority 2 - features - will be necessary for the system to be of value to the user.  Automatic notification of matches, match level, a system to select interests, a way to interact are all examples of priority 2 items.

  Priority 3 - functionality - will be items that make an improvement to the way the site functions, its efficiency, its usability, documentation and help reporting, and administrative interfaces.


Story Points:

Story Points will be powers of 2, since estimations of effort are typically exponential.

  1 is something that can be implemented in a few minutes by a skilled coder or debugger.  Correcting a minor coding error is an example, or writing a user story.

  2 is something that is well known and can be implemented in an hour or two by a skilled operator.  This might be implementing an interface where code is mostly copied from something else we've done, installing a new package, or sketching a layout or documenting a procedure.

  4 is something that is known as technically feasible, but we don't really know how to do it.  We can expect to have to look up references, try a few approaches, or trying several layouts to check models with a user.  It is a task that you might expect to do in a full day of work.

  8 is something that is new to the assignee.  If they are in a new language, implementing a new concept, or trying something mentioned in class that has never been done by them, you might expect them to take most of the week to get any production at all.

  16 is experimental


Item Listing Order:

Items will be included in the sprint or backlog in the order that they would normally be executed, with acknowledgement to the fact that many tasks and activities can be executed simultaneously.

This will be a combination of Functional Order, Priority, and story points/estimated effort, in that order.  So functional order takes precidense over priority and effort, etc when defining the listing order of items in the sprint or backlog


Acceptance Criteria:

Interface specifications and models, whether programmic or user, will be linked to the item and pointed out in the acceptance criteria.
Functionality, methods names, parameters and return types will be specified in the interface specification and linked along with it.
Specific parameters or descriptions of user interfaces will be included in acceptance criteria.
Testability specification, where definable, should be included with acceptance criteria.
Performance specification, where applicable, should be included in acceptance criteria.
Acceptance criteria should be clear and concise, giving consideration to how it can be misinterpreted and clarifying
