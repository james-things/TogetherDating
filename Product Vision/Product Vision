Visions Statement -
Adventure Together connects outdoor oriented, athletic, active people 20 to 50 with others who have similar activity interests and experience levels to foster interpersonal relationships within an activity community; from workout partners, friends, casual relationships, to dating. Members create their profiles which include basic profile information plus activity preferences and experience levels, match preferences, and a short bio, which may include photos and/or a short video. Once a member has fully populated their profile and verified their identity, they start reviewing and building a queue of potential matches. From a queue of matches, a member can request to connect with another member – moving the member from the queue of potential matches to a queue of Explorers – via in app text and video messaging. If members agree to connect in the real world, members move from the queue of Explorers to the queue of Expeditioners. At any time, members can remove themselves from another member’s queue, disconnect, block, or report other members.
